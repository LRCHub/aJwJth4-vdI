```
'Cause it feels like Heaven
When it hurts so bad
Baby, put it on me
I like it just like that
Just like that
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty,
nasty, nasty—
Is somebody gonna match
my freak?
Is somebody gonna match
my freak?
Is somebody gonna match
my nasty?
I got stamina,
they say I'm an athlete
(Oh, ah)
Is somebody gonna match
my freak?
(My freak)
(Oh, ah)
Need somebody
with a good technique?
(Good technique)
(Oh, ah)
Is somebody gonna match
my nasty?
Pillow talking
got my throat raspy
If you keep up with me
I'll keep on coming back
If you do it too good
I'm gonna get attached
'Cause it feels like Heaven
When it hurts so bad
Baby, put it on me
I like it just like that
Just like that
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
(Just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty,
nasty, nasty—
(I like it just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
(Just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty,
nasty, nasty—
Big time, pull up, make a scene
Party's lame, no vibe,
we can leave
Shotgun, my thighs on his seat
I ain’t got nothing underneath
Looks like you're
'bout to spend the night
(Uh-uh)
Freak side,
I'm 'bout to change your life
(Uh-uh)
Wife type,
he's staying for a week
(Uh-uh)
So I might just hit him
with the lease
If you keep up with me
I'll keep on coming back
(Oh-ooh)
If you do it too good
I'm gonna get attached
(Oh-ooh)
'Cause it feels like Heaven
When it hurts so bad
Baby, put it on me
I like it just like that
(Like it)
Just like that
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
(Just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty,
nasty, nasty—
(I like it just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
(Just like that)
I've been a nasty girl, nasty
(Oh)
I've been a nasty,
nasty, nasty—
If you keep up with me
I'll keep on coming back
If you do it too good
I'm gonna get attached
'Cause it feels like Heaven
When it hurts so bad
Baby, put it on me
I like it just like that
(Like it just like that)
Just like that
(Uh-uh)
Nasty, nasty, nasty—
(Uh-uh)
(Uh-uh)
Nasty, nasty, nasty—
(Uh-uh)
(Uh-uh)
Nasty, nasty, nasty—
(Uh-uh)
(Uh-uh)
Nasty, nasty, nasty—
(Uh-uh)
